Hen and chicks (also known as hen-and-chickens, or hen-widdies in the American South) is a common name for a group of small succulent plants, a term that indicates a plant that possesses enlarged parts to store water. [1] It belongs to the flowering plant family Crassulaceae, native to southern Europe and northern Africa. The plants grow close to the ground with leaves formed around each other in a rosette, and propagating by offsets. The "hen" is the main, or mother, plant, and the "chicks" are a flock of offspring,[2] which start as tiny buds on the main plant and soon sprout their own roots, taking up residence close to the mother plant.
